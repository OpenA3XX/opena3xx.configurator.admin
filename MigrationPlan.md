Recommended Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Foundation Components (Week 1-2)
Goal: Create the most impactful reusable components that can be used alongside existing components
1.1 DataTableComponent (Week 1)
Why First: Used in every "manage" component (hardware panels, aircraft models, etc.)
Impact: Eliminates 80% of table boilerplate
Implementation: Create alongside existing tables, not replace them
Usage: New features can use this, existing features remain unchanged
1.2 PageHeaderComponent (Week 1)
Why First: Every page has the same header pattern
Impact: Eliminates header boilerplate across all features
Implementation: Extract header logic, keep existing page structure
Usage: New pages use this, existing pages keep their current headers
1.3 FormDialogComponent (Week 2)
Why First: All add/edit dialogs follow the same pattern
Impact: Standardizes all dialog forms
Implementation: Create new dialog component, existing dialogs remain
Usage: New dialogs use this, existing dialogs stay as-is
Phase 2: Layout Components (Week 3-4)
Goal: Create layout components that can wrap existing content
2.1 PageLayoutComponent (Week 3)
Why: Provides consistent page structure
Implementation: Wrapper component that accepts projected content
Usage: New pages use this, existing pages remain unchanged
2.2 DashboardLayoutComponent (Week 4)
Why: For connectivity and dashboard features
Implementation: Grid layout wrapper for existing components
Usage: New dashboard pages use this, existing ones stay as-is
Phase 3: Supporting Components (Week 5-6)
Goal: Enhance existing functionality with reusable components
3.1 ConfirmationDialogComponent (Week 5)
Why: Standardize all confirmation dialogs
Implementation: Service-based dialog that can be called from anywhere
Usage: Replace individual confirmation dialogs gradually
3.2 SearchFilterComponent (Week 5)
Why: Standardize search functionality
Implementation: Standalone component that can be added to existing pages
Usage: Add to existing pages without changing their structure
3.3 StatusBadgeComponent (Week 6)
Why: Consistent status indicators
Implementation: Simple component that can replace inline status text
Usage: Gradually replace status text in existing components
Phase 4: Enhancement Components (Week 7-8)
Goal: Add advanced functionality that can be integrated into existing components
4.1 LoadingStateComponent (Week 7)
Why: Consistent loading states
Implementation: Component that can wrap existing content
Usage: Add to existing components without changing their logic
4.2 EmptyStateComponent (Week 7)
Why: Consistent empty state handling
Implementation: Component that can be conditionally shown
Usage: Add to existing tables and lists
4.3 DetailViewComponent (Week 8)
Why: Standardize detail page layouts
Implementation: Card-based layout wrapper
Usage: New detail pages use this, existing ones remain
Implementation Strategy
Approach: Additive, Not Replacing
Create New Components: All new components are additions to the SharedModule
Keep Existing Logic: No changes to existing component logic
Gradual Adoption: New features use new components, existing features remain
Optional Integration: Existing components can optionally use new components
